\section*{US Ersatz Math Olympiad -- Problem Statements}

\subsection*{Problem 1}
Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. A circle centered at $O$ passes through $B$ and $D$
and meets lines $BA$ and $BC$ again at points $E$ and $F$ (distinct from $A,B,C$).
Let $H$ denote the orthocenter of triangle $DEF$.
Prove that if lines $AC$, $DO$, and $EF$ are concurrent, then triangles $ABC$ and $EHF$
are similar.

\subsection*{Problem 2}
Let $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ denote the set of single-variable polynomials in $x$ with integer coefficients.
Find all functions $\theta : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to \mathbb{Z}[x]$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item for any polynomials $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, we have $\theta(p+q)=\theta(p)+\theta(q)$;
  \item for any polynomial $p \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$, the polynomial $p$ has at least one integer root
        if and only if $\theta(p)$ has at least one integer root.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Problem 3}
Consider an infinite grid $G$ of unit square cells.
A \emph{chessboard polygon} is a simple polygon whose sides lie along the gridlines of $G$.
Nikolai chooses a chessboard polygon $F$ and challenges you to paint some cells of $G$ green,
such that any chessboard polygon congruent to $F$ has at least one green cell but at most
$2020$ green cells.
Can Nikolai choose $F$ to make your job impossible?

\subsection*{Problem 4}
Prove that for any prime $p$, there exists a positive integer $n$ such that
\[
1^n + 2^{\,n-1} + 3^{\,n-2} + \cdots + n^1 \equiv 2020 \pmod{p}.
\]

\subsection*{Problem 5}
Let $P$ be a regular polygon, and let $V$ be the set of its vertices.
Each point in $V$ is colored red, white, or blue.
A subset of $V$ is called \emph{patriotic} if it contains an equal number of points of each color,
and a side of $P$ is called \emph{dazzling} if its endpoints are of different colors.
Suppose that $V$ is patriotic and the number of dazzling edges of $P$ is even.
Prove that there exists a line, not passing through any point of $V$, dividing $V$ into two
nonempty patriotic subsets.

\subsection*{Problem 6}
Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle with circumcenter $O$ and altitudes $AD$, $BE$, $CF$.
Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be the midpoints of $AD$, $BE$, $CF$, respectively.
Lines $AD$ and $YZ$ intersect at $P$, lines $BE$ and $ZX$ intersect at $Q$,
and lines $CF$ and $XY$ intersect at $R$.
Suppose that lines $YZ$ and $BC$ intersect at $A_0$, and lines $QR$ and $EF$ intersect at $D_0$.
Prove that the perpendiculars from $A,B,C,O$ to the lines $QR$, $RP$, $PQ$, $A_0D_0$,
respectively, are concurrent.
